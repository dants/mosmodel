# Introduction
Mosmodel is is primarily useful for architectural virtual memory studies. It allows researchers to construct mathematical models that predict the runtime of applications executing on top of some newly proposed virtual memory design. This methodology requires a partial simulation of only the said newly proposed memory subsystem, as opposed to a full "cycle accurate" simulation of the entire processor.
The Mosmodel repo is fully automated and contains all required tools to produce the Mosmodel for any workload on any x86-64 Linux system.

# Setup and Configuration
Before you start building and running Mosmodel, you need to set and configure the following:
- Update the following variables in `benchmark.mk`:
    - `BENCHMARK_COMMAND`: an executable or script that runs the benchmark.
    - `MMAP_POOL_LIMIT` (defaults to 100MB):

# Technical Details
Mosmodel assumes that the benchmark allocates < 100MB through `mmap()`. In case your benchmark allocates more than 100MB, please increase the `MMAP_POOL_LIMIT` in benchmark.mk
Mosmodel scans only Mosalloc layouts on the `brk()` pool because it assumes that the benchmark allocates memory through `malloc()`. In case your benchmark uses different allocators (than glibc `malloc()`), please update the TODO script, which creates the Mosalloc layouts.
